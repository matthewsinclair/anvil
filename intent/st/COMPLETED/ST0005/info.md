# ST0005: Documentation Update - Multi-File Technical Product Design

## Objective

Restructure Anvil's Technical Product Design document from a single file into a comprehensive multi-file structure, following the pattern established by MeetZaya projects. This improves document maintainability, navigation, and allows for more detailed technical specifications.

## Context

The original Technical Product Design was a placeholder document with minimal content. As Anvil has grown from concept to working implementation, comprehensive technical documentation is needed to:

- Document the as-built architecture and design decisions
- Provide clear specifications for future development
- Enable new team members to understand the system
- Serve as reference for API consumers and SDK users
- Establish patterns for testing and deployment

The multi-file structure allows each aspect of the system to be documented in detail while maintaining easy navigation through an index file.

## Related Steel Threads

- ST0001: Anvil prompt management system - Core functionality documented in TPD
- ST0003: Organisations own projects - Multi-tenancy design captured in TPD
- ST0006: Testing framework (planned) - Test strategy documented in Chapter 9

## Context for LLM

This documentation effort created a comprehensive 10-chapter Technical Product Design covering:

1. Introduction - Project overview and goals
2. Requirements - Functional and non-functional requirements
3. Architecture - System design and technology choices
4. Data Model - Database schema and relationships
5. API Design - REST API and SDK specifications
6. User Interface - UI/UX design patterns
7. Security - Authentication, authorization, and data protection
8. Deployment - Infrastructure and operations
9. Testing - Test strategy and implementation
10. Future Considerations - Roadmap and extensibility

Each chapter is maintained as a separate markdown file with version tracking, while the main technical_product_design.md serves as an index.
