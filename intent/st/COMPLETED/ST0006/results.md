   - Clear separation enabling different execution strategies

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

1. **Domain Coverage**:
   - **Accounts**: User management, authentication, token handling
   - **Organisations**: Multi-tenancy, memberships, personal org protection
   - **Projects**: Project CRUD within organisations
   - **Prompts**: Complete prompt workflow, template validation, versioning
   - **Policies**: Authorization, cross-org isolation, role-based permissions

2. **Test Type Distribution**:
   - Unit tests: 141 (73%) - Fast, focused resource testing
   - Integration tests: 51 (27%) - End-to-end workflow validation
   - Achieving excellent balance following testing pyramid principles

### Key Features Delivered

1. **Fast Development Workflow**:
   ```bash
   mix test  # 141 tests, ~2-3 seconds
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Validation**:
   ```bash
   TEST_ANVIL_INTEGRATIONS=true mix test  # 192 tests, complete coverage
   ```

3. **Policy Enforcement Validation**:
   - Cross-organisation data isolation verified
   - Role-based permissions tested across all domains
   - Personal organisation protection confirmed

4. **Integration Test Infrastructure**:
   - Route categorization and accessibility testing
   - Authentication workflow validation
   - Complete user journey testing across all major features

## Metrics

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 192
- **Unit Tests**: 141 (73%)
- **Integration Tests**: 51 (27%)
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (0 failures)
- **Test Files**: 24 files organized by domain

### Coverage Areas
- **Authentication**: 4 integration tests
- **Dashboard**: 9 integration tests  
- **Organisations**: 8 integration tests + 17 unit tests
- **Projects**: 11 integration tests + 16 unit tests
- **Prompts**: 13 integration tests + 68 unit tests (including addresses)
- **Policies**: 40 unit tests ensuring isolation and authorization
- **Routes**: 6 integration tests for accessibility

### Performance Metrics
- **Unit Test Execution**: ~2-3 seconds (development workflow)
- **Full Test Suite**: ~10-15 seconds (CI/CD workflow)
- **Zero External Dependencies**: No ChromeDriver, Docker, or external services required

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **PhoenixTest Excellence**: PhoenixTest proved superior to Wallaby for integration testing:
   - No external dependencies (ChromeDriver, etc.)
   - Faster execution
   - Better LiveView support
   - Simpler CI/CD setup

2. **Ash.Generator Power**: Using Ash.Generator for test data provided significant benefits:
   - Respects all Ash validations and policies
   - Handles complex relationships correctly
   - Consistent with production code paths
   - More maintainable than raw Ecto operations

3. **Environment Protection Strategy**: The TEST_ANVIL_INTEGRATIONS guard system provided optimal development experience:
   - Fast feedback during development (unit tests only)
   - Comprehensive validation when needed (full suite)
   - Clear separation of concerns

### Process Insights

1. **MeetZaya Pattern Adaptation**: Successfully adapted proven MeetZaya testing patterns to Anvil's Ash Framework architecture, demonstrating pattern portability across different technical stacks.

2. **Policy-First Testing**: Testing policies through actual operations (rather than in isolation) proved more effective:
   - Catches integration issues
   - Ensures real-world scenarios work
   - More maintainable test code

3. **Infrastructure-First Approach**: Building comprehensive test infrastructure in Phase 1 enabled rapid development of all subsequent test phases.

### Best Practices Established

1. **Test Organization**: Clear separation between unit and integration tests with different helper requirements
2. **Data Generation**: Consistent use of factories and generators for maintainable test data
3. **Authentication Testing**: Comprehensive authentication flow testing with proper session management
4. **Policy Testing**: Thorough testing of authorization policies through real operations

## Follow-up Work

### Immediate (Not Required for ST0006 Completion)
- None - ST0006 objectives fully achieved

### Phase 6 Options Available for Future Implementation

1. **Option A: API Testing Layer** - JSON API and GraphQL endpoint testing
2. **Option B: Performance/Load Testing** - Benchmarking and optimization validation  
3. **Option C: End-to-End Browser Testing** - Full browser automation with JavaScript
4. **Option D: Test Quality Enhancement** - Property-based testing and mutation testing
5. **Option E: CI/CD Integration** - Workflow optimization and test reporting

### Maintenance Considerations

1. **Test Maintenance**: Regular review of test coverage as new features are added
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor test execution time as suite grows
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Eventual integration with GitHub Actions for automated testing
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep testing guides current with new patterns

## Conclusion

ST0006 successfully delivered comprehensive testing infrastructure that exceeds initial objectives. The implementation provides both fast development feedback and thorough validation, establishing testing patterns that will serve the project throughout its lifecycle. With 192 tests achieving 100% pass rate and comprehensive domain coverage, Anvil now has a robust foundation for confident development and deployment.

The successful adaptation of MeetZaya patterns to Ash Framework demonstrates the value of proven testing approaches while the intelligent environment protection system optimizes for both development speed and validation thoroughness.
