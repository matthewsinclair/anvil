# Results - ST0001: Anvil Prompt Management System

## Summary

The Anvil Prompt Management System MVP has been successfully implemented with core functionality for managing prompts, projects, and prompt sets. The system provides a complete web UI for context engineers to create and manage prompts with Liquid template support.

## Delivered Features

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅

- **Ash Framework Domain Models**: Projects, PromptSets, Prompts, Versions, and Users
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Custom types for parameter storage with proper migrations
- **Authentication**: phx_gen_auth integration with protected routes
- **Authorisation**: Basic Ash policies checking resource ownership
- **Seed Data**: Development seeds for easy testing

### Phase 2: Web Application ✅

- **Phoenix LiveView UI**: Complete CRUD operations for all resources
- **Dynamic Forms**: Real-time parameter management with add/remove functionality
- **Template Validation**: Visual feedback for missing/unused/matched parameters
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumb component and command palette (Cmd+K)
- **User Experience**: Retro-themed UI with consistent styling
- **Global Pages**: Dashboard, Account, Settings, and Help pages

### Phase 3: Template Engine (Partial) ✅

- **Liquid Templates**: Solid gem integration for template rendering
- **Variable Extraction**: Regex-based parser for template variables
- **Parameter Validation**: Automatic detection of missing parameters
- **Auto-population**: One-click parameter creation from template variables

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Custom Type System

Created `Anvil.Types.ParameterList` to handle the complexity of storing parameter definitions as PostgreSQL jsonb arrays while maintaining type safety and form compatibility.

### 2. Atomic Database Operations

Implemented atomic slug generation using PostgreSQL fragments within Ash changes, ensuring database consistency without race conditions.

### 3. LiveView Architecture

Successfully converted entire application to LiveView, providing real-time updates and seamless user experience without complex JavaScript.

### 4. Command Palette Pattern

Implemented a global command palette accessible via Cmd+K from any page, improving navigation efficiency.

## Metrics

### Code Statistics

- **Domains**: 3 (Projects, Prompts, Accounts)
- **Resources**: 5 (Project, PromptSet, Prompt, Version, User)
- **LiveViews**: 15+ pages
- **Custom Components**: Breadcrumbs, Command Palette, Parameter Manager
- **Lines of Code**: ~3,000 (excluding generated code)

### Development Time

- **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure completed in 1 session
- **Phase 2**: Web UI completed in 2 sessions
- **Phase 3**: Template engine basics completed in 1 session

## Known Issues

### 1. Version Management UI

While the Version resource exists, the UI for version comparison and management is not yet implemented.

### 2. Template Rendering

Template validation works but actual Liquid rendering through Solid gem needs error handling improvements.

### 3. Search Functionality

No search capability implemented yet - navigation relies on listing pages and command palette.

## User Feedback Needed

### 1. Parameter Types

Currently supports string, number, and boolean. Need feedback on:

- Additional types needed (array, object, date?)
- Default value support
- Validation rules

### 2. Template Features

- Custom Liquid filters for LLM-specific needs
- Template composition/inheritance
- Preview with sample data

### 3. Workflow

- Approval process for :review mode
- Version publishing workflow
- Collaboration features

## Technical Debt

### 1. Test Coverage

- No comprehensive test suite yet
- Need unit tests for Ash resources
- Need integration tests for LiveViews
- Need end-to-end workflow tests

### 2. Error Handling

- Basic error display but needs improvement
- No graceful degradation for template errors
- Missing user-friendly validation messages

### 3. Performance

- No pagination on listing pages
- No caching implemented
- No query optimisation done

## Next Phase Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 4)

1. **Client Library**: Build Anvil.get/2 for consuming prompts
2. **Version Comparison**: UI for viewing version differences
3. **Basic Search**: At least project/prompt name search

### Medium-term Goals (Phase 5)

1. **Bundle Export/Import**: Enable prompt distribution
2. **Registry Service**: Central repository for sharing
3. **Embedded Mode**: Mount Anvil within existing Phoenix apps

### Long-term Vision (Phase 6)

1. **Live Updates**: PubSub-based real-time updates
2. **Analytics**: Usage tracking and A/B testing
3. **Workflow Engine**: Advanced approval processes

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Ash Framework Power

Ash Framework significantly accelerated development with built-in features like policies, changes, and relationships. The atomic operation support was particularly valuable.

### 2. LiveView Benefits

Converting everything to LiveView provided consistency and eliminated the need for custom JavaScript while maintaining excellent UX.

### 3. PostgreSQL Flexibility

Custom types and jsonb arrays provided the flexibility needed for dynamic parameter definitions without sacrificing type safety.

### 4. Iterative Development Works

Starting with core features and progressively enhancing allowed rapid progress while maintaining system stability.

## Conclusion

The Anvil MVP successfully demonstrates the viability of a prompt management system. Core functionality is solid, and the architecture supports planned enhancements. The system is ready for initial user testing while development continues on advanced features.

Key success factors:

- ✅ Clean domain model with Ash Framework
- ✅ Intuitive UI with real-time validation
- ✅ Flexible template system with Liquid
- ✅ Solid foundation for future features

The project is well-positioned for the next phase of development focusing on distribution and consumption of prompts.
