# ST0006: Testing Core Functionality

## Objective

Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure for Anvil, covering unit tests for Ash resources, integration tests for LiveView flows, and API tests for REST endpoints. The testing framework should ensure data integrity, policy enforcement, and proper user experience across all features.

## Context

ST0006 has successfully implemented comprehensive testing infrastructure for Anvil, transforming the project from minimal test coverage to a robust 192-test suite with zero failures. The implementation addressed all critical testing needs including:

- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage preventing regressions during development
- ✅ Complete data isolation testing between organisations
- ✅ Thorough policy enforcement validation across all domains
- ✅ Living documentation through behaviour-focused tests
- ✅ Foundation for confident refactoring and feature development
- ✅ Test infrastructure supporting continuous deployment workflows

The steel thread successfully established testing patterns based on MeetZaya's proven approach, expertly adapted for Anvil's specific architecture using Ash Framework and Phoenix LiveView.

## Related Steel Threads

- ST0001: Anvil prompt management system - Core functionality to be tested
- ST0003: Organisations own projects - Multi-tenancy features requiring isolation testing
- ST0005: Documentation update - Test strategy documented in TPD Chapter 9

## Context for LLM

ST0006 successfully delivered comprehensive testing infrastructure with the following achievements:

1. **Testing Stack Implemented**: ExUnit + PhoenixTest + Ash.Generator working seamlessly
2. **Test Distribution Achieved**: Unit (141 tests, 73%), Integration (51 tests, 27%)
3. **Complete Coverage**: Authentication, authorisation, data isolation, all CRUD operations
4. **MeetZaya Patterns**: Successfully adapted DataCase, FeatureCase, and Generator patterns

### Implementation Results

1. ✅ **Testing Infrastructure**: Complete with cases, helpers, generators
2. ✅ **Unit Tests**: 141 comprehensive tests for all Ash resources
3. ✅ **Integration Tests**: 51 tests covering all critical user flows
4. ✅ **API Coverage**: Prompt retrieval and health check endpoints tested
5. ⏸️ **CI/CD Integration**: Deferred to Phase 6 options

### Current Status

**Ready for Sign-off**: All primary objectives achieved with 192 tests, 0 failures. Phase 6 advanced options identified and deferred. ST0006 can be marked complete upon final review.
